- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @thepccoder
- ðŸ‘€ I love to play the drums, and spend a lot of my free time learning new songs.  I upload covers of my songs to YouTube so that I can review my progress over time.

I've been a professional software developer for approximately 25 years.  My primary field of expertise has been in Windows Desktop development using the .NET Framework and C#.  Before that I developed in Visual Basic.  When .NET was first released I made the changeover to VB.NET; however, I quickly realized the benefits of C# and I have never looked back.  I've had a few brief moments developing web applications with traditional ASP.NET.
